# MyMinecraftLauncher

A dependency-free Minecraft launcher in a single Python script.

## To Do

- Faster asset downloading (Async? Retry?)
- Progress bar!
- Don't let windows freeze (execute commands on other "thread")
- MacOS, Linux?
- Use system Java installation when available (and the right version)
- Better adhering to library rules, extration rules, argument rules
- Follow Python naming conventions better (private class fields, private global variables)
- Game JVM arguments???
